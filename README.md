# React from the Ground Up

We cover the fundementals of React including
- create a new React App starting with node.js
- more about JSX
- how your page's DOM events can interact with State (onChange, onClick,etc)
- review of useState()  & how to avoid mutating state
- more uses of useEffect() - fetch data from a Web Service
- create a Custom Child Component with "props" (attributes)

There is a branch for every phase of what we covered in the lecture, starting with "1-new-project" (as generated by the React cli).  You can follow along with each of the branches.  The "master" branch is the final application.
